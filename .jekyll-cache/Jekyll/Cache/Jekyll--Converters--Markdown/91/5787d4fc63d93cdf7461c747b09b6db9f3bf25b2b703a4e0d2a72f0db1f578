<h2 id="pass-the-ticket-psremoting-double-hop-bypass">[<a href="./prjct/PTT-PSRemoting.html">Pass-the-Ticket: PSRemoting Double-hop Bypass</a>]</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The double-hop problem occurs when, for example, a local PowerShell instance connected via PSRemoting to a remote server which is connected to the target server and an attempt to execute commands on the target server was made and was rejected. The end goal of this proof-of-concept is to execute a pass-the-ticket attack on an active directory while being remotely connected to a domain computer with administrator privileges.</p>
