<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Come one, come all! We've opened up a brand new website that allows the Lapland people to vote the next big town hall project! Just upload your ideas on the platform and vote using your CPU power. We've made sure voting takes a great amount of effort, so there's no easy way to play the system.

If you are indeed able to vote more than 250 times, you will be congratulated as an active Lapland citizen and receive a prize worthy of this title.

Remote server: http://challs.xmas.htsp.ro:11001
Author: Milkdrop
Note: The ideas you post are public and logged, posting any X-MAS flags may disqualify your team
Note 2: You must send all 250 votes from the same PHP session, otherwise the server will not be able to send you the flag.
</code></pre></div></div>
